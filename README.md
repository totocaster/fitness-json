# About fitness·json

**fitness·json** is a family of data interchange objects based on JavaScript Object Notation (JSON), designed specifically for storing and sharing sport, fitness, and health data. It defines several types of JSON objects and how they are combined to represent data about athletes' workouts, fitness profiles, and guided workout instructions.

The whole ecosystem is designed for endurance athletes such as runners, cyclists, triathletes, para-triathletes, and the like. The format of the data is friendly to both computers and humans, and can be easily explored, adjusted, and extended.

## FAQ <a id="faq"></a>

### **Why another file format?** 

None of the existing file formats are both computer- *and* user-friendly. Most are XML schema extensions built on top of mapping or GIS file formats. The goal of **fitness·json** is to be simple, friendly, and easily parsable by both modern apps and human eyes.

### **Can I use fitness·json in my application/project?** 

Yes. The file format is open and intended for wide adoption.

### **Can I contribute to fitness·json?** 

Yes, you can use custom extensions to store any information in fitness·json files without approval from the community. Alternatively, you can suggest features and changes for the next fitness·json release in our [community forums](https://tride.community/fitnessjson). 

### **Is there a license fee?** 

No, fitness·json is entirely open and free to use and adapt. Everything about the format is as open-source as possible. The evolution process is also happening in the open.
