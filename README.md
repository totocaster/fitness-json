# About fitness·json

fitness·json is a family of data interchange objects based on JavaScript Object Notation \(JSON\) designed specifically for the storing and sharing of sport, fitness, and health data. It defines several types of JSON objects and how they are combined to represent data about athlete's workouts, fitness profile, and guided workout instructions. 

The whole ecosystem is designed for endurance athletes such as runners, cyclists, triathletes, para-triathletes, and alike. The format of the data is friendly to both—computers and humans—and can be easily explored, adjusted, and extended.

## FAQ <a id="faq"></a>

### **Why another file format?** 

None of the existing file formats are computer _and user-friendly_. Most are XML schema extensions on top of mapping or GIS file formats. The goal of fitness·json is to be simple, friendly, and easily parsable both my modern apps and human eyes.

### **Can I use fitness·json in my application/project?** 

Yes. The file format is open and intended for wide-adoption.

### **Can I contribute fitness·json?** 

Yes, you can use custom extensions to store any information in fitness·json files without any approval from the community. Alternatively, you can suggest featues and changes for the next fitness·json release in our [community forums](https://tride.community/fitnessjson). 

### **Is there a licence fee?** 

No, fitness·json is entirely open and free to use and adapt. Everything about the format is as open-source as possible. The evolution process is also happening in the open.
